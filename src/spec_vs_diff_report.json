  "summary": "REQ-24 is largely implemented: the player now fades in volume on autoplay, on user-initiated Play, and on each loop restart via an `ended` handler. However, the diff shows the component forcing `audio.muted = true` on mount, which may violate the acceptance criterion that fade-in must not change the user’s mute state (depending on prior behavior/state).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "The fade-in must not change the user’s mute state: if the user is muted, the player remains muted and no audible sound is produced.",
      "reason": "The updated code explicitly forces the audio element to be muted on mount (`audio.muted = true`) and initializes React mute state to `true`, which can change the user’s mute/unmute state rather than preserving it.",

      "reason": "REQ-24 asks for fade-in on loop restart but does not require changing loop mechanics; the diff introduces manual loop handling and comments that loop is disabled.",
