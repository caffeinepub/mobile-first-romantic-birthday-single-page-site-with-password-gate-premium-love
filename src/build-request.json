      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When the background music begins playing (autoplay start or after pressing Play), its volume ramps up from near-silent to the intended listening volume over a short, smooth fade-in.",
        "When the track reaches the end and restarts (loop), the restart is not abrupt; the audio fades in again on the new loop iteration.",
        "The fade-in must not change the user’s mute state: if the user is muted, the player remains muted and no audible sound is produced.",
        "Play/Pause and Mute/Unmute controls continue to work as they do now, with no UI regressions.",
        "No backend changes are required."

    "Adding fade-out behavior (only fade-in is required).",
    "Changing which audio file is used (continue using the existing local /background.mp3 source).",
